Welcome to Small Square's documentation!
========================================

Small Square is a modular lightweight and easy-to-learn C++ Game Engine. Or, at least, it aims to be.
This site is it's official documentation. It has tutorials and guides that, I hope, will help you understand Small Square.
If you're looking for the Small Square API Documentation (built with doxygen), here it is: `api link`_.
