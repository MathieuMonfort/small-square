##Export as Wavefront .obj
    Blender doesn't use the same axis order as Small Square. ( X Right, Y Front, Z Up for blender and X Left, Y Up, Z front for Small Square)
    Therefore you shoud import wavefront from blender with the following export transform parameters: 
            
            Scale : 1.00
            Path  Mode : Auto 
            Forward : -Z Forward
            Up : Y Up 

    They both use a right hand axis system so your models shouldn't be fliped at all;
